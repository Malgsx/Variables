# Variables
Simple variable functions using Jupyter Notebook for beginners.

### **********************Variable**********************

In Python, a variable is a name that is used to refer to a value stored in the computer's memory. When you create a variable, you can assign it a value, and then later you can use the variable to retrieve or modify the value. Variables are an essential part of programming, as they allow you to store and manipulate data within your program.

To create a variable in Python, you use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to the variable. For example:

In this example, the variable **`x`** is assigned the value **`5`**. You can then use the variable **`x`** in your program to refer to the value **`5`**.

Variables can store values of different types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and so on. You can use variables to store and manipulate data in a variety of ways, such as performing arithmetic operations, concatenating strings, and more.

It is important to choose descriptive and meaningful names for your variables to make your code more readable and easier to understand. In Python, variable names can contain letters, digits, and underscores, but they must start with a letter or an underscore. It is also a good idea to follow the Python style guide and use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words in your variable names.

In this video, the presenter explains how to use variables in Python. Variables are used to store data values and can contain a value such as a number or string. Variables also assign their own data type, so you don't need to specify it. It is also possible to overwrite previous variables and variables are case sensitive. Additionally, you can assign multiple values to multiple variables, or multiple variables to one value. The presenter also discusses best practices for naming variables, such as camel or Pascal case and snake case, which is the most readable. Finally, the presenter explains how to use variables within print statements, including adding strings and integers, separated by a comma.
