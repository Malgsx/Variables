Simple variable functions using Jupyter Notebook for beginners.

### **********************Variable**********************

In Python, a variable is a name that is used to refer to a value stored in the computer's memory. When you create a variable, you can assign it a value, and then later you can use the variable to retrieve or modify the value. Variables are an essential part of programming, as they allow you to store and manipulate data within your program.

To create a variable in Python, you use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to the variable. For example:

x = 5

In this example, the variable **`x`** is assigned the value **`5`**. You can then use the variable **`x`** in your program to refer to the value **`5`**.

Variables can store values of different types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and so on. You can use variables to store and manipulate data in a variety of ways, such as performing arithmetic operations, concatenating strings, and more.

It is important to choose descriptive and meaningful names for your variables to make your code more readable and easier to understand. In Python, variable names can contain letters, digits, and underscores, but they must start with a letter or an underscore. It is also a good idea to follow the Python style guide and use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words in your variable names.
